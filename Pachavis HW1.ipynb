Here, workflow is defined as the process by which the project is managed and developed.\n",

The first step that I take when debugging is reading the error message and going to the error line to try and understand and find what is going wrong.  This is usually good enough to fix it there is a small easy mistake to solve.  If this does not work, I will try to google the error and get suggestions from there, have another party check to see if they understand it, or go through line by line near the error to try to understand more what is going on.  If the bug is not showing an error, but rather just giving incorrect output, I do go through line by line for ask for help from another party to get a fresh set of eyes to understand what is wrong.
